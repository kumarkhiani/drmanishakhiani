                        <h4><i>How Homeopathy Works</i></h4>
                        <p>Homeopathic medicines are diluted to the point where no original molecule is present in the
                            medicine. Lot of research work is being carried out and here is some research on it.</p>

                        <p>One of the leading current proposals points that water is capable of storing information
                            relating to substances with which it has been in contact.

                            The Swiss chemist, Louis Rey, found that structure of Hydrogen bonds in Homeopathic medicine
                            is different from that of pure water.

                            Many recent researches are pointing that water has a “memory” and it has a structure.</p>
                        <p>Another noble prize winning scientist, emeritus professor of Cambridge University, Dr. Brian
                            Josephson wrote this response to an article about Homeopathy in New Scientist.

                            “Regarding your comments on claims made for Homeopathy criticisms centered around the
                            vanishingly small number of solute molecules present in a solution after it has been
                            repeatedly diluted are beside the point, since advocates of Homeopathic remedies attribute
                            their effects not to molecules present in the water, but to modifications of the water’s
                            structure.

                            “Simple-minded analysis may suggest that water, being a fluid, cannot have a structure of
                            the kind that such a picture would demand. But cases such as that liquid crystals, which
                            while flowing like an ordinary fluid can maintain an ordered structure over macroscopic
                            distances, show the limitations of such ways of thinking. There have not, to the best of my
                            knowledge, been any refutations of homeopathy that remain valid after this particular point
                            is taken into account.</p>

                        <p>Also, a group of highly respected scientist have confirmed that the vigorous sharing involved
                            with making homeopathic medicines changes the pressure in the water.

                            These scientist have shown how the homeopathic process of using double distilled water and
                            then diluting and shaking the medicine in a sequential fashion changes the structure of
                            water.</p>
