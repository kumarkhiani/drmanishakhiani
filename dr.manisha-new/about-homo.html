                    <h4><i>About Homeopathy</i></h4>
                    <p>Homeopathy is a complete system of medicine developed by the German Physician and scientist, <b>Dr.
                        Samuel Hahnemann</b> in 1856. It is a Science which has been existing and growing world wide
                        from last 200 years.</p>

                    <p><b>Homeopathic treatment aims to stimulate and direct the body&rsquo;s self healing capacity by
                        triggering a reaction.</b> The body reacts to stimuli, which have physiological effects( drugs
                        and toxins) by attempting to maintain homeostasis ( stable internal environment). Homeopathy
                        makes therapeutic use of this effect.</p>

                    <p>Homeopathic medicines are prescribed according to a law known as the &ldquo;<b>Law of
                        Similars</b>, Sometimes expressed as like cures like&rdquo;. This law allows homeopaths to
                        correct symptoms of ill-health with substances that produce similar symptoms when tested on a
                        healthy person.</p>

                    <p>The medicine cure diseases only because they can produce similar symptoms in healthy
                        individuals.</p>

                    <p>Homeopathic medicines are being proved on healthy individuals. Both Mental as well as physical
                        symptoms are recorded while proving medicine. More than 2000 remedies are being used by
                        homeopaths in clinics for the treatment of diseases.</p>

                    <p>Hence you will find your Homeopath asking you many questions pertaining not only to physical
                        symptoms but also deep enquiry is made on mental symptoms like your Will, intellect and
                        Sensitivities. Your diligence, Anger, fear and weeping all sorts of emotions are considered.</p>

                    <h4><i>Making Homeopathy Medicines</i></h4>
                    <p>Homeopathic Medicines are prepared from Plants, Animals and Minerals and are extremely
                        diluted.</p>

                    <p> Homeopathic medicines are made by diluting a medicinal substance in a double distilled water.
                        Each substance is diluted, most commonly 1 part of the original medicinal agent to 9 or 99 parts
                        double distilled water.</p>

                    <p> The mixture is then vigorously shaken. The solution is then again diluted 1:9 or 1:99 and
                        vigorously shaken.</p>

                    <p>This process of consecutive diluting and shaking is repeated 3, 6, 12, 30, 200, 1000 or more&#8230;</p>

                    <p>Thus Homeopathic medicines are &ldquo;potentized&rdquo; (the process of sequential dilution with
                        vigorous shaking in between each dilution). In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is
                        described as having a higher potency. More diluted substance are considered by homeopaths to be
                        stronger and deep acting.</p>

                    <p>30C and below are called as low potencies and 200 is called as moderate potency. 1M and above are
                        called as Higher potencies.</p>
