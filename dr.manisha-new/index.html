                                from
                                fever lasting for 5 days. Not only did she find the right remedy immediately through a
                                very
                                thorough consultation, which isn’t the standard in Hong Kong’s rushed environment. She
                                also
                                showed a lot of personal care by checking on his recovery several times—even on the

                                friends.

                                remedy treatments. My entire being has increased in confidence and I feel that I can

                                day with a smile and positive thoughts. In the beginning of my interactions with Dr.
                                Manisha, I
                                felt very anxious and stressed due to the hard pressures of the Hong Kong educational
                                system.
                                Over the course of the two months I have spent with her, I have learned to look within
                                myself
                                and slowly bring harmony to my body that has helped to increase the overall calm of my
                                exterior. I can finally sleep again! I am eternally grateful to Dr. Manisha! She has
                                been a joy and

                            <p>“I came to see Dr. Manisha 3 months ago and was in complete despair. I had very heavy
                                menses and irregular in nature due to multiple fibroids in my uterus. I had lots of
                                joint pain with a
                                history of fever, too.
                                Dr. Manisha took a detailed history of mine and gave me medicine that fits my
                                constitution.
                                Within span of just few days my body ache and joint pain became better and my cycle
                                became
                                regular. I did have good flow of menses which was not heavy for these last 2 cycles. I
                                continued
                                to visit her and now my periods are regular with normal flow.
                                I appreciate Dr. Manisha for her help, she is a very compassionate and detailed person.
                                She is
                                really thorough and excellent in her prescription. I highly recommend her to all my
