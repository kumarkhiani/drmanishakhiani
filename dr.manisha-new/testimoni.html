                            menses and irregular in nature due to multiple fibroids in my uterus. I had lots of joint
                            pain with a
                            history of fever, too.
                            Dr. Manisha took a detailed history of mine and gave me medicine that fits my constitution.
                            Within span of just few days my body ache and joint pain became better and my cycle became
                            regular. I did have good flow of menses which was not heavy for these last 2 cycles. I
                            continued
                            to visit her and now my periods are regular with normal flow.
                            I appreciate Dr. Manisha for her help, she is a very compassionate and detailed person. She
